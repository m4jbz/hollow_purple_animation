# Animation/Simulation of Gojo's hollow purple technique

I try to make a simulation of the Gojo's hollow purple technique from Jujutsu Kaisen in C using [raylib](htts://raylib.com) library.

The attract, move, get_normal and get_dist functions ara based on [CodeMaker4 raylib-particle-toy project](https://github.com/codemaker4/raylib-particle-toy).
