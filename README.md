# Animation/Simulation of Gojo's hollow purple technique

I try to make a simulation of the Gojo's hollow purple technique from Jujutsu Kaisen in C using [htts://raylib.com](raylib) library.

The attract, move, get_normal and get_dist functions ara based on [https://github.com/codemaker4/raylib-particle-toy](CodeMaker4 raylib-particle-toy project).
