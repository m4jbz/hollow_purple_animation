# Animation/Simulation of Gojo's hollow purple technique

I try to make a simulation of the Gojo's hollow purple technique from Jujutsu Kaisen in C using [raylib](https://raylib.com) library.

The attract, move, get_normal and get_dist functions ara based on [CodeMaker4 raylib-particle-toy project](https://github.com/codemaker4/raylib-particle-toy).

## Build or compile

Just run on your terminal:

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Run

If you are using st terminal I recommend to use tmux to get a better look.
```bash
./main
```

And of course to this two things to work you need to have installed raylib and all its dependencies.
